The provided documentation outlines the development of Emily, a software ecosystem designed to prioritize human agency and psychological calm over traditional notification-heavy interfaces. The backend architecture utilizes a simplified, local, and dependency-free Go event log to buffer external data from sources like X.com, ensuring that information is processed asynchronously rather than in real-time. A graphical frontend built with C, SDL2, and OpenGL establishes a minimalist, game-like space where background tasks—such as Monero mining and Dogecoin wallet management—provide real-world value without demanding constant user attention. This "Agency Hack" replaces high-pressure dashboards with spatial representations of data, using custom monospace fonts and intentional stillness to reduce burnout. By strictly separating background effort from the user experience, the system allows individuals to interact with digital systems at their own pace. Ultimately, the project serves as a technical manifesto for building "unagents" that offer situational awareness without the ethical pitfalls of modern attention-grabbing applications.
